## Requirements and dependencies

## Running as a Docker container

Ideally, you want to run this as a stateless Docker container configured entirely by environment variables. Therefore, you don't even need to deploy 
this code anywhere yourself - just use our [public Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pwred/vrata).

Deploying it is as easy as:

```bash
$ docker run -d -e GATEWAY_SERVICES=... -e GATEWAY_GLOBAL=... -e GATEWAY_ROUTES=... pwred/vrata
```

Where environment variables are JSON encoded settings (see configuration options below).

## Features

- Built-in OAuth2 server to handle authentication for all incoming requests
- Aggregate queries (combine output from 2+ APIs)
- Output restructuring 
- Aggregate Swagger documentation (combine Swagger docs from underlying services) *
- Sync and async outgoing requests 
- DNS service discovery *

* work in progress

## Installation

You can either do a git clone or use composer (Packagist):

```bash
$ composer create-project poweredlocal/vrata
```
